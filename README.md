# UMD Buoy 

Welcome to the repository for our buoy projects and IMU data processing library. This repository contains the source code for two buoy systems as well as a dedicated library for real-time processing of IMU data.

## Overview

This project includes code for:

- **LTE_Buoy:**  
  A cellular buoy built on stm32duino. It utilizes the Blues Notecard and SWAN.

- **SAT_Buoy:**  
  **[Placeholder]**  
  Arduino-based buoy code that uses an Iridium communications module. More details will be added as the project develops.

- **wave_processing:**  
  A dedicated library for processing IMU data in real time. This is split into two parts:
  - **wave_processor:** The C library designed for integration into the buoy systems.
  - **python_processing:** A set of experimental Jupyter notebooks and scripts used to develop and test wave processing algorithms before they are implemented in C.
